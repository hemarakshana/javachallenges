## How to Download & Set Up Eclipse

### 🔹 Step 1: Install Eclipse IDE
1. Download **Eclipse IDE for Java Developers** from [Eclipse's official website](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
2. Install Eclipse and launch it.

### 🔹 Step 2: Create a Java Project in Eclipse
1. Open Eclipse and click **File → New → Java Project**.
2. Enter a project name (e.g., `JavaChallenges`) and click **Finish**.

### 🔹 Step 3: Create a Package and Class
1. In the **Package Explorer**, right-click on `src`, select **New → Package**, and name it (e.g., `com.javachallenges`).
2. Right-click the package and select **New → Class**.
3. Enter a class name (e.g., `Day1`) and check **public static void main(String[] args)**.
4. Click **Finish**, and start coding!


## How to Run the Programs
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-daily-challenges
   ```
2. Open the project in Eclipse.
3. Run a Java file by right-clicking the class and selecting **Run As → Java Application**.

## Future Plans
✔️ Continue learning advanced Java topics such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures, and Algorithms.
